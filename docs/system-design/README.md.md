# Step by step

### 1. Requirements clarifications:

- What the system dose?

### 2. Back-of-the-envelope estimation:

- How big is the data
- How much traffic we need to serve

### 3. Define data model:

- Draw ERD (internal)

### 4. System interface definition:

- API design (external)

### 5. High-level design:

- System diagram
- Which components do we need
- How components communicate each others

### 6. Detailed design:

- UML diagram (use case diagram, sequence diagram, activity diagram)

### 7. Identifying and resolving bottlenecks:

- Find ways to optimize system performance -> improve design
